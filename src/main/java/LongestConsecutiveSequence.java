/**
 * This program finds the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an array.
 *
 * Idea:
 * 1. Add all elements to a HashSet for O(1) lookups.
 * 2. Iterate through the array, and for each number:
 *      - Check if it is the **start of a sequence** (i.e., num - 1 is not in the set).
 *      - If yes, keep incrementing to find the length of the consecutive sequence.
 * 3. Track the maximum sequence length.
