/**
 * This program finds the second smallest and second largest elements in an integer array.
 *
 * Idea:
 * 1. We maintain two variables for largest and secondLargest.
 * 2. Similarly, two variables for smallest and secondSmallest.
 * 3. Traverse the array once, updating these variables whenever a new largest/smallest is found.
 * 4. For each element:
 *    - If it's bigger than the current largest, it becomes the new largest, and the old largest becomes secondLargest.
 *    - If it's smaller than the current smallest, it becomes the new smallest, and the old smallest becomes secondSmallest.
 *    - If it falls between largest and secondLargest, or smallest and secondSmallest, update the respective second values.
